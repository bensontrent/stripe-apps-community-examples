// types/paywall.ts
//
// ============================================================================
//  Paywall — the single definition of "may this Stripe account use the app?"
// ============================================================================
//
// IDENTICAL copies of this file live in both projects:
//
//   stripe-app-nextjs-backend/src/types/paywall.ts   (decides, authoritatively)
//   stripe-app/src/types/paywall.ts                  (renders the decision)
//
// Keep them in sync — same arrangement as src/types/settings.ts. Nothing here
// imports anything, so the file compiles in both.
//
// The model, in one paragraph: access belongs to the STRIPE ACCOUNT, not to
// the person. An account may use the paid features when (a) the app runs in
// test mode — testing is always free, (b) someone in the account has an
// active subscription, or (c) the account's free trial is still running. The
// trial has two limits, both configured on the backend: TRIAL_DAYS_LIMIT
// (calendar days since the trial started) and TRIAL_COUNT_LIMIT (how many
// times the paid feature may be used). Whichever runs out first ends it.
//
// resolvePaywall() below is the whole decision. The backend calls it with
// what the database says and sends the result to the app; the app never
// decides for itself, it only renders `status.view`. (The function is shared
// so the app's demo can preview every state and so both sides can unit-test
// the same rules.)
//
// To change the rules — a grace period for past-due invoices, a trial that
// starts at install instead of on first use — change resolvePaywall() in
// both copies and its tests. Nothing else encodes them.
// ============================================================================
